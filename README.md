# DungeonBuilder

This Android application will generate a random dungeon map, and give the user the ablity to view it on their device in B&W or create and email and HTML file.

The Android UI is simple and not overly robust, just put together as a quick UI to access the generator. Also, since it is just a quick demo, I did not target lower end devices as some of the methods used require higher end APIs.

You should be able to open the project in Android studio and run it.

The main inspiration for the generator was from http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/
I borrowed a good bit from this, but at least did not choose tools already built in JAVA for more of a challenge :)
